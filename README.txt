Models exported from the PerfectGold Editor can't be opened in Blender. I used Noesis to convert the models so they can be opened in Blender. I appended "FIXED - " to the converted models.

This will allow you to create custom characters using Blender.

Some issues:
 * UV mapping is messed up (thank Nintendo / the editor)
 * No bones, just joints.
 * No Special parts (Fox's gun etc)

Below is the guide I made to "fix" these models so you won't have to:

Guidelines for importing PerfectGold SSB64 FBX animations into Blender
Blender has issues importing FBX files that have been generated by the editor. We use Noesis to "fix" the file so that Blender can read it properly. If you have access to Maya, you should probably use that instead.
Get Noesis: http://n64vault.com/ssb-tools:noesis
This guide assumes that you have already setup the Autodesks FBX SDK to work with the PerfectGold editor.

Importing to Blender:
1. Export the desired animation from PerfectGold's model editor. Refer to http://n64vault.wdfiles.com/local--files/ssb-docs%3Aanimation-file-documentation/animationfilelist for a list of animations.
2. Open Noesis, find the file, right click and export.
	- Generally, I add -fbxmeshmerge into the advanced options to prevent the room names from being renamed.
	- You may try other commands. Click "Advanced Commands" to see the whole 	list.
3. Import the file into Blender. I just used the default FBX import options.
4. You should now be able to edit the model and see the animation.

I don't know what the best export settings are. Here's what works for me:
Set to default preset,
Set ArmatureFBXNodeType to LimbNode,
Uncheck NLA Strips,
Uncheck All Actions.
